Main idea for text: explore what happens if executive meddling is invoked on important technology (like internet is being broken by governments everywhere)

Story outline: 
tech inventor makes tech
some influencer (govt, CEO, ...) tries to manipulate tech in order to serve some (not-public) interest
influencer causes tech to have modification that serves non-public interest
original creator breaks tech (TODO: add some choice of whether to break; keeping it must have benefit)
people are unhappy when tech is modified, but less so when tech broken
people independetly clone tech, so influencer incapable of controlling it

Specifics:
- tech is voice-activated AI, controls (pre-existing) connected devices 
- influencer is president of country, controls by laws
- modification is surveillance and automatic reporting (for reasons of law enforcement)
%- reason it is broken is false triggering (that cannot be fixed: see https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/17/its_artificial_its_intelligent_its_in_my_home_and_its_gone_bonkers/)
